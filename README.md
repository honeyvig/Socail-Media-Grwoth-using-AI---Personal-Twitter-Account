# Twitter API credentials
API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
ACCESS_SECRET = 'your_access_secret'

# Authenticate with Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET)
auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_SECRET)
api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)

                if not user.following and not user.follow_request_sent:
                    api.create_friendship(user.id)
                    print(f"Followed: {user.screen_name}")
        except tweepy.TweepError as e:
